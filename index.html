								<h3> Overview </h3>
								<p>The aftermath of a Computer malware attack can cause billions of dollars in damage. Malware such as trojans can disguise themselves to stay hidden on your computer while stealing sensitive information. 32% of the world’s computers are infected with some type of malware, however, an even higher percentage of people don’t check. <a href="https://www.varonis.com/blog/cybersecurity-statistics/">ref</a></p>

								<p>The term malware comes from malicious software. Malware is malicious code taking the form of an innocent program or file designed to control or alterthe way your computer works. There are many different types of malware butthe most common are viruses, worms, trojans and ransomware. No matter what malware you come across, it is important to know what steps you need to take in order to remove it because the outcome will always be the same. The intentions behind malware usually fall between the lines of demanding ransom or to steal sensitive personal data. <a href="https://www.avg.com/en/signal/what-is-malware">ref</a></p>

								<p>It would be more effective to put money into advertising malware prevention rather than spending it to cover the costs of the damages.
								<br>
								Many people don’t realise how dangerous malware is and how you are puttingyour personal data at risk if such malware gains access into your computer.If people are more aware of how these threats enter our computers then theamount of money spent on damage control and stolen data will be reduced inthe future. <a href="https://www.avg.com/en/signal/what-is-malware">ref</a></p>

								<p>I have decided to design an interactive website called .exe which will help a range of audiences to learn about computer malware. The website willinform them on how dangerous malware is and how to avoid it to preventdamages and stolen information. I will present this infromation in the formof an infographic on my website allowing my audience to intake plenty of information in as few words as possible</p>

								<h2 class="major">Journal</h2>
								<p>Here is the updated step by step process i did each day for this project - you can also refer to my journal on blackbaord for images and explanations on design decisions. <i>(this journal is ONLY a summary on what I did on each day)</i></p>
								
								<b>11/09/20</b>
								<p>Today I started working on my prototyping ideas for project two. I went back into my pitch documents from project one and had a look at the wireframes and concepts I roughly drew up. Branching from those wireframes I started looking at exisitng websites for further inspiration. I wanted my website to be interactive and not just a static web page you read information off of.
								<br><br>
								I also thought about a physical prototype I could create for this project. My idea involved invisible ink pens and some paper. I wanted to create a fun activity for my audience where they would have to find the virus using a uv lit pen. There would be many 1's and 0's drawn with the invisible ink as well making it harder to find the bug. Although this idea is fun, I didn't think it was teaching my audience much on computer malware so I settled for creating the website. This would also be more efficient because I can develop my prototype further for the final design output later on.
								</p>

								<b>13/09/20</b>
								<p>I thought it would be better to create my website using a template so I started searching for templates under creative commons. There were many templates that had excellent design but they didn't suit the theme of my website. In the end I really couldnt find a template that went side by side with what I had envisioned but I could work with it.
								<br><br>
								I designed a new wireframe to follow and starting noting down the different sections my website could have.
								</p>

								<b>15/09/20</b>
								<p>I started working on the very first page of my website. This page is supposed to look exactly like the dangerous webpage that comes up on malware infected sites. This is the result of the page:
								<span class="image main"><img src="assets/img/danger.png" alt="danger"/>
								</p>

								<b>17/09/20</b>
								<p> I was looking at the concept I drew up for the homepage and I realised that I may need more statistics for my website. I googled computer malware statistic and did some more research on the topic. I was specifically looking for statistics with percentages or numbers because my website will incorporate some counter functionality. I didn't really find much on what I was looking for but I did note down some information that may be useful for the virus and trojan pages.<br><a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/interesting-facts-about-computer-viruses/#:~:text=More%20than%206000%20new%20computer,more%20than%2048%2C%20000%20viruses.">research one</a><br><a href="https://purplesec.us/resources/cyber-security-statistics/ ">research two</a>
								</p>

								<b>21/09/20 & 22/09/20</b>
								<p>On these days I spent most of my time deisgning all the pages that make up my website. I had a few design ideas in my head that I struggled to show nicely on the website but other than that I produced a good amount of work on my website. You can see my process on the blackboard journals. The primary element I needed to work on my website was the interactive adware page. I was afraid that I wouldn't be able to get it working as I have never attempted pop up windows. Luckily nicepage had a great tutorial on how to set up a popup window. I simply entered the code they provided and it worked! <br><a href="https://nicepage.com/doc/create-a-modal-popup-55883">tutorial ref</a>
								</p> 

								<b>13/09/20</b>
								<p>Today I went into the media lab to present my prototype to my group. They gave me good verbal feedback on what worked well and what didn't. They also left comments on the forum so I can look back on it. I am using today to refine my prototype based on the feedback given to me by my classmates.
								<br><br>
								The last part I need to complete is the documentation via a website.</p>

								<b>Reflection</b>
								<p> When I first read the brief for this project I wasnt sure which direction I wanted to go with. I wanted to do something pysical but thought that my prototype would be presented better on a digital platform.
<br><br>
								I am a little bit shocked how my website turned out becasue I wasn't expecting it to turn out the way it did. I had something else in mind but this isn't a negative as I am still happy with the result. Usuaully when I make websites I stick to the standard clean and pressional looking layout but this time I went out of my comfort zone and desgined a more compacted and messy website. The messy looked suits the topic of computer malware as they are very destructive. I feel like my website is more appealing for my audience to look and interact with being it isnt your typical blank page and text.
								<br><br>
								I did struggle a lot with this design style because there were many clashes in elements especially when I was layering the text with shapes. Sometimes objects would look off centre and the colour scheme didn't go well with each other. I had to play around with many different combinations of colours and elements to get the right look.
<br><br>
								Overall my website displays the messy minimalist aesthetic I was going for and I am happy that I got all the functionality that I needed to work because people can now gain the full experience of whats to come for my website.

								<h2 class="major">Stakeholders</h2>
								<p>These are all the stakeholder's comments and feedback I received. They are all internet users from around the world between the ages of 15 and 25. When I sent this out to the stakeholders, most of them were familiar with the warning page which is great to know.
								All their suggestions were taken into consideration when I went back to develop and refine my prototype.

								<h2 class="major">Presentaton</h2>
								<p>Here is a summary of my presentation done in the media lab</p>
								<b>WHAT IS IT</b>
								<p>My prototype is a website. The way I would like to present this to a wider audience or publicize it is through email spams. It may be ironic because the whole purpose is to avoid dangerous emails but I think it would be an effective way for me to get my narrow down the more vulnerable audiences.</p>
								<b>WHO IS IT FOR</b>
								<p>My website is for anyone who uses the internet. It is primarirly targetted towards those who have little to no knowledge about computer malware or want to learn more about this topic. I can see this website being used in schooling for children so they are more aware of these threats at a younger age.</p>
								<b>WHAT WILL IT DO</b>
								<p> my website will promote internet safety for all internet users by providing them with important information on computer malware. This includes how you get it, how it spreads and how to prevent it. I also have multiple signs and interactives that link to infecting your computer with malware. These include the first load up page, it is a warning page for people to retreat but if they don't they may infect their computers. The other one is an online interative where pop up ads and warnings will come up if you tap on the risky links. All these are created for the purpose of familiarising my target audiences of how and where these threats hide.</p>
